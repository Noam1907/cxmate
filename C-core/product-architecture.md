# CX Mate - Three-Layer Product Architecture

## The Journey Model

CX Mate maps the journey your customers take — from the first time they hear about you to becoming long-term advocates. Companies choose what to map based on where they are right now.

### Journey Types

| Type | Scope | Example Stages |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Sales Journey** | First touch → Closed deal | Awareness, Evaluation, Demo/Trial, Negotiation, Close |
| **Customer Journey** | Onboarding → Advocacy | Onboarding, Adoption, Value Realization, Expansion, Renewal |
| **Full Lifecycle** | First touch → Advocacy | All of the above, with the sales→customer handoff as a key moment |

During onboarding, the user picks which journey type to start with. They can always expand later.
