# CX Mate - Project Brief

## What CX Mate Is

CX Mate is an AI co-pilot for simple customer experience architecture — built for small businesses.

It helps you picture your customer journey, highlights the moments that really matter, and shows you how to act on them step by step — without needing a CX expert, big budgets, or complex tools.

## The Problem

Small businesses know customer experience matters, but they don't have the tools or expertise to do anything about it. Enterprise CX platforms are expensive, complex, and designed for teams of 50+. So small businesses wing it — relying on gut feel, spreadsheets, and founder memory until customers quietly leave.

## How CX Mate Solves It

1. **Picture your journey** — Tell us about your business in 5 minutes. CX Mate's AI maps your customer journey (sales, post-sale, or both) based on your industry, stage, and how you work.
2. **See what matters** — CX Mate highlights the meaningful moments in your journey — the make-or-break points where customers decide to stay, buy, or leave.
3. **Know what to do** — For each moment, get clear, actionable steps: what to do, what to say, when to act. No CX jargon, just practical guidance.

## Journey Scope

CX Mate covers the **full revenue lifecycle**. Companies choose what to map based on where they are:

| Journey Type | Scope | Who It's For |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **Sales Journey** | First touch → Closed deal | Early-stage companies building their sales process |
| **Customer Journey** | Onboarding → Advocacy | Companies focused on retention and growth |
| **Full Lifecycle** | First touch → Advocacy | Companies that want one unified view across sales and CS |

## Target Customer

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Company Size | Small businesses (5-300 employees) |
| Stage | Any — from just starting to actively scaling |
| Vertical | Any B2B (SaaS initial focus, expanding to services, agencies, etc.) |
| Buyer | Founder, COO, Head of CS, CRO, or anyone who owns the customer relationship |
| Current Solution | Gut feel + spreadsheets + whatever CRM they have |
| Budget | $99-499/month |

## Target User Personas

### 1. The Founder (5-50 employees)
- **Pain:** Wears every hat, no time to think about CX strategy, losing customers without knowing why
- **Goal:** Get a CX foundation in place in minutes, not months

### 2. The Revenue Leader / CRO (50-300 employees)
- **Pain:** Sales and CS are disconnected, no unified view from deal to renewal
- **Goal:** One map from first touch to advocacy, reduce revenue leakage

### 3. The Head of CS (30-150 employees)
- **Pain:** Managing customer health reactively, no playbook, team is growing
- **Goal:** Proactive engagement, standardized approach, reduce churn

## Competitive Positioning

CX Mate wins by being the **simplest path to a CX strategy**. Not the most powerful — the most accessible.

- No direct competitor bundles journey mapping + recommendations for small businesses
- Enterprise tools (Gainsight, Qualtrics, Medallia) are 10-100x the price and complexity
- We're not competing with them — we're the on-ramp before companies need them
