# CX Mate - Project Brief

## What CX Mate Is

CX Mate is an AI-powered CX orchestration platform — like having a CCXP-certified CX expert on your team, powered by AI.

It maps your entire customer journey, surfaces the moments that make or break your business, connects every insight back to your real data, and gives you a step-by-step playbook to act on — all in under 5 minutes.

## The Problem

Companies know customer experience matters, but they don't have the tools or expertise to do anything about it. Enterprise CX platforms (Gainsight, Qualtrics, Medallia) are expensive, complex, and designed for teams of 50+. So companies wing it — relying on gut feel, spreadsheets, and founder memory until customers quietly leave.

The gap isn't between "no CX" and "enterprise CX." It's that there's nothing in the middle: no way to get a CX foundation in place without a dedicated CX hire or a six-figure platform.

## How CX Mate Solves It

1. **Tell us about your business** — Enter your company name and website. CX Mate auto-enriches your profile (vertical, size, competitors) and walks you through a conversational onboarding — maturity-adaptive, persona-aware, with AI-suggested answers.
2. **Get your CX architecture** — CX Mate's AI generates a complete journey map, CX Intelligence Report (with transparent impact projections and assumptions), and Evidence Wall — all grounded in real CX methodology (lifecycle science, decision science, failure patterns).
3. **Know what to do** — For every meaningful moment, get a prioritized playbook with actionable recommendations, AI tool suggestions, email templates, and evidence annotations that connect back to your specific pain points and competitors.

## Journey Scope

CX Mate covers the **full revenue lifecycle**. Companies choose what to map based on where they are:

| Journey Type | Scope | Who It's For |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **Sales Journey** | First touch → Closed deal | Pre-customer companies building their sales process |
| **Customer Journey** | Onboarding → Advocacy | Companies focused on retention and growth |
| **Full Lifecycle** | First touch → Advocacy | Companies that want one unified view across sales and CS |

Pre-customer companies selecting "Full Lifecycle" are automatically guided to sales-only content — no customer-stage recommendations they can't act on.

## Target Customer

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Stage | Companies that haven't hired a CX expert yet (stage-based, not size-based) |
| Vertical | Any B2B (SaaS initial focus, expanding to services, agencies, FinTech, etc.) |
| Buyer | Founder, COO, Head of CS, CRO, or anyone who owns the customer relationship |
| Current Solution | Gut feel + spreadsheets + whatever CRM they have |
| Budget | Free first taste → $99-499/month |
| Maturity Levels | Pre-launch, First Customers, Growing, Scaling (adaptive onboarding) |

## Target User Personas

### 1. The Founder (pre-launch to first customers)
- **Pain:** Building without a CX playbook, no idea which moments matter, losing early customers without understanding why
- **Goal:** Get a CX foundation in place in minutes, not months — before bad habits form

### 2. The Revenue Leader / CRO (growing stage)
- **Pain:** Sales and CS are disconnected, no unified view from deal to renewal, revenue leaking at handoff points
- **Goal:** One map from first touch to advocacy, reduce revenue leakage, quantified impact projections

### 3. The Head of CS (growing to scaling)
- **Pain:** Managing customer health reactively, no playbook, team is growing faster than processes
- **Goal:** Proactive engagement, standardized approach, evidence-backed recommendations tied to their actual pain points

## Key Differentiators

1. **Auto-enrichment** — Enter your website, CX Mate researches your company and pre-fills your profile
2. **Evidence-based** — Every recommendation links back to your specific pain points, competitors, and challenges
3. **Maturity-adaptive** — Onboarding, analysis depth, and recommendations change based on your CX maturity stage
4. **Transparent methodology** — Impact projections show their calculation formulas and data sources (your data vs. industry benchmarks)
5. **CX expertise built in** — CCXP-level methodology (lifecycle science, decision science, 8-module knowledge base) — not just generic AI
6. **Dual-mode architecture** — Try before you sign up (anonymous preview), save when you're ready (authenticated persistence)

## Competitive Positioning

CX Mate wins by being the **smartest path to a CX strategy**. Not the most powerful — the most accessible AND credible.

- No direct competitor bundles journey mapping + evidence-based recommendations + auto-enrichment for companies without CX teams
- Enterprise tools (Gainsight, Qualtrics, Medallia) are 10-100x the price and complexity
- Generic AI tools can't match the structured CX methodology layer
- We're not competing with enterprise — we're the CX foundation before companies need enterprise tools
- The defensibility is in the structured CX knowledge base underneath, not the AI layer on top
